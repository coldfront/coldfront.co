                <h3>Travel to and from the airport</h3>

                <p>If you are flying into Copenhagen you will arrive at and depart from Copenhagen Airport (CPH). The easiest way to get to hotel is by taking the train lines <strong>029 / 1027 / 1029 / 1031 / 1033 / IC</strong> to <strong>Copenhagen Central Station</strong>.</p>
                <p>When you exit the arrival area in the airport (Terminal 3), simply to continue straight ahead until you see the Train signs. Before going down to the tracks, go the the ticket machines and buy Zone 4 ticket, which takes you down town. The trains departs every 10th minute, so don't worry if you miss a train.</p>

                <p>Please note that Copenhagen don't have Uber/Lyft, and taxies in general are expensive</p>

                <h3>The conference hotel</h3>

                <p>Your hotel is the <strong><a href="http://savoyhotel.dk">Savoy Hotel</a></strong>. The Savoy Hotel is housed in the Løvenborg building and is designed by the architect Anton Rosen, who is also known for the Tuborg building in Hellerup and the Palace Hotel at the Town Hall Square (Rådhuspladsen).</p>

                <p>The Art Nouveau building was built in 1906 and was renamed as a historical monument in 1985 after an extensive restoration work.  The impressive “curtain wall facade”, the first of its kind in Denmark, detail of the building with for example small animal heads on the wall on the inner courtyard, the beautiful lions on the stucco around the elevator and the round windows are all classic Art Nouveau details.</p>

                <p>Random fact: The building was originally the <strong>first in Denmark to have an elevator</strong>. And today, more than 100 years later, the elevator is still working and can be used by hotel guests.</p>
